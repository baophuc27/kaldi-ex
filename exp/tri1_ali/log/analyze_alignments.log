The optional-silence phone sil occupies 25.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 76.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 14.4 hours of data, or 10.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 1.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,17.2,50)
