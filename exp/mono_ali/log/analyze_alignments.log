The optional-silence phone sil occupies 26.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 75.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 3.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 14.6 hours of data, or 10.7 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (18,22.9,56)
